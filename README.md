# Random-Forest
Random Forest is a popular machine learning algorithm that belongs to the supervised learning technique. As the name suggests, "Random Forest is a classifier that contains a number of decision trees on various subsets of the given dataset and takes the average to improve the predictive accuracy of that dataset." The greater number of trees in the forest leads to higher accuracy and prevents the problem of overfitting.
